Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black.\\nOoh, black and yellow!\\nLet's shake it up a little.\\nBarry! Breakfast is ready!\\nComing!\\nHang on a second.\\nHello?\\nBarry?\\nAdam?\\nCan you believe this is happening?\\nI can't.\\nI'll pick you up.\\nLooking sharp.\\nUse the stairs, Your father paid good money for those.\\nSorry. I'm excited.\\nHere's the graduate.\\nWe're very proud of you, son.\\nA perfect report card, all B's.\\nVery proud.\\nMa! I got a thing going here.\\nYou got lint on your fuzz.\\nOw! That's me!\\nWave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.\\nBye!\\nBarry, I told you, stop flying in the house!\\nHey, Adam.\\nHey, Barry.\\nIs that fuzz gel?\\nA little. Special day, graduation.\\nNever thought I'd make it.\\nThree days grade school, three days high school.\\nThose were awkward.\\nThree days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around The Hive.\\nYou did come back different.\\nHi, Barry. Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.\\nHear about Frankie?\\nYeah.\\nYou going to the funeral?\\nNo, I'm not going.\\nEverybody knows, sting someone, you die.\\nDon't waste it on a squirrel.\\nSuch a hothead.\\nI guess he could have just gotten out of the way.\\nI love this incorporating an amusement park into our day.\\nThat's why we don't need vacations.\\nBoy, quite a bit of pomp under the circumstances.\\nWell, Adam, today we are men.\\nWe are!\\nBee-men.\\nAmen!\\nHallelujah!\\nStudents, faculty, distinguished bees,\\nplease welcome Dean Buzzwell.\\nWelcome, New Hive City graduating class of 9:15.\\nThat concludes our ceremonies And begins your career at Honex Industries!\\nWill we pick our job today?\\nI heard it's just orientation.\\nHeads up! Here we go.\\nKeep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times.\\nWonder what it'll be like?\\nA little scary.\\nWelcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group.\\nThis is it!\\nWow.\\nWow.\\nWe know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life.\\nHoney begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to The Hive.\\nOur top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey!\\nThat girl was hot.\\nShe's my cousin!\\nShe is?\\nYes, we're all cousins.\\nRight. You're right.\\nAt Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence.\\nThese bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology.\\nWhat do you think he makes?\\nNot enough.\\nHere we have our latest advancement, the Krelman.\\nWhat does that do?\\nCatches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it.\\nSaves us millions.\\nCan anyone work on the Krelman?\\nOf course. Most bee jobs are small ones.\\nBut bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot.\\nBut choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life.\\nThe same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that.\\nWhat's the difference?\\nYou'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years.\\nSo you'll just work us to death?\\nWe'll sure try.\\nWow! That blew my mind!\\n\\\"What's the difference?\\\"\\nHow can you say that?\\nOne job forever?\\nThat's an insane choice to have to make.\\nI'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life.\\nBut, Adam, how could they never have told us that?\\nWhy would you question anything? We're bees.\\nWe're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth.\\nYou ever think maybe things work a little too well here?\\nLike what? Give me one example.\\nI don't know. But you know what I'm talking about.\\nPlease clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach.\\nWait a second. Check it out.\\nHey, those are Pollen Jocks!\\nWow.\\nI've never seen them this close.\\nThey know what it's like outside The Hive.\\nYeah, but some don't come back.\\nHey, Jocks!\\nHi, Jocks!\\nYou guys did great!\\nYou're monsters!\\nYou're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!\\nI wonder where they were.\\nI don't know.\\nTheir day's not planned.\\nOutside The Hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what.\\nYou can't just decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that.\\nRight.\\nLook. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime.\\nIt's just a status symbol.\\nBees make too much of it.\\nPerhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it.\\nThose ladies?\\nAren't they our cousins too?\\nDistant. Distant.\\nLook at these two.\\nCouple of Hive Harrys.\\nLet's have fun with them.\\nIt must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock.\\nYeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom!\\nHe had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me!\\nOh, my!\\nI never thought I'd knock him out.\\nWhat were you doing during this?\\nTrying to alert the authorities.\\nI can autograph that.\\nA little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades?\\nYeah. Gusty.\\nWe're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow.\\nSix miles, huh?\\nBarry!\\nA puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it.\\nMaybe I am.\\nYou are not!\\nWe're going 0900 at J-Gate.\\nWhat do you think, buzzy-boy?\\nAre you bee enough?\\nI might be. It all depends on what 0900 means.\\nHey, Honex!\\nDad, you surprised me.\\nYou decide what you're interested in?\\nWell, there's a lot of choices.\\nBut you only get one.\\nDo you ever get bored doing the same job every day?\\nSon, let me tell you about stirring.\\nYou grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around.\\nYou get yourself into a rhythm.\\nIt's a beautiful thing.\\nYou know, Dad, the more I think about it,\\nmaybe the honey field just isn't right for me.\\nYou were thinking of what, making balloon animals?\\nThat's a bad job for a guy with a stinger.\\nJanet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey!\\nBarry, you are so funny sometimes.\\nI'm not trying to be funny.\\nYou're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer!\\nYou're gonna be a stirrer?\\nNo one's listening to me!\\nWait till you see the sticks I have.\\nI could say anything right now.\\nI'm gonna get an ant tattoo!\\nLet's open some honey and celebrate!\\nMaybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody \\\"dawg\\\"!\\nI'm so proud.\\nWe're starting work today!\\nToday's the day.\\nCome on! All the good jobs will be gone.\\nYeah, right.\\nPollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal...\\nIs it still available?\\nHang on. Two left!\\nOne of them's yours!

Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one.\\nDeady. Deadified. Two more dead.\\nDead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life!\\nOh, this is so hard!\\nHeating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer, humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, mite wrangler.\\nBarry, what do you think I should... Barry?\\nBarry!\\nAll right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine...\\nWhat happened to you?\\nWhere are you?\\nI'm going out.\\nOut? Out where?\\nOut there.\\nOh, no!\\nI have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life.\\nYou're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?\\nAnother call coming in.\\nIf anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd that gets their roses today.\\nHey, guys.\\nLook at that.\\nIsn't that the kid we saw yesterday?\\nHold it, son, flight deck's restricted.\\nIt's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.\\nReally? Feeling lucky, are you?\\nSign here, here. Just initial that.\\nThank you.\\nOK.\\nYou got a rain advisory today, and as you all know, bees cannot fly in rain.\\nSo be careful.

Bringing it around.\\nStand to the side, kid.\\nIt's got a bit of a kick.\\nThat is one nectar collector!\\nEver see pollination up close?\\nNo, sir.\\nI pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe a dash over there, a pinch on that one.\\nSee that? It's a little bit of magic.\\nThat's amazing. Why do we do that?\\nThat's pollen power. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.\\nCool.\\nI'm picking up a lot of bright yellow, Could be daisies, Don't we need those?\\nCopy that visual.\\nWait. One of these flowers seems to be on the move.\\nSay again? You're reporting a moving flower?\\nAffirmative.\\nThat was on the line!\\nThis is the coolest.

I'm talking with a bee.\\nYeah.\\nI'm talking to a bee. And the bee is talking to me!\\nI just want to say I'm grateful.\\nI'll leave now.\\nWait! How did you learn to do that?\\nWhat?\\nThe talking thing.\\nSame way you did, I guess. \\\"Mama, Dada, honey.\\\" You pick it up.\\nThat's very funny.\\nYeah.\\nBees are funny. If we didn't laugh, we'd cry with what we have to deal with.\\nAnyway... Can I... get you something?\\nLike what?\\nI don't know. I mean... I don't know. Coffee?\\nI don't want to put you out.\\nIt's no trouble. It takes two minutes.\\nIt's just coffee.\\nI hate to impose.\\nDon't be ridiculous!\\nActually, I would love a cup.\\nHey, you want rum cake?\\nI shouldn't.\\nHave some.\\nNo, I can't.\\nCome on!\\nI'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.\\nWhere?\\nThese stripes don't help.\\nYou look great!\\nI don't know if you know anything about fashion.\\nAre you all right?\\nNo.\\nHe's making the tie in the cab as they're flying up Madison.\\nHe finally gets there.\\nHe runs up the steps into the church.\\nThe wedding is on.\\nAnd he says, \\\"Watermelon?\\nI thought you said Guatemalan.\\nWhy would I marry a watermelon?\\\"\\nIs that a bee joke?\\nThat's the kind of stuff we do.\\nYeah, different.\\nSo, what are you gonna do, Barry?\\nAbout work? I don't know.\\nI want to do my part for The Hive, but I can't do it the way they want.\\nI know how you feel.\\nYou do?\\nSure.\\nMy parents wanted me to be a lawyer or a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.\\nReally?\\nMy only interest is flowers.\\nOur new queen was just elected with that same campaign slogan.\\nAnyway, if you look... There's my hive right there. See it?\\nYou're in Sheep Meadow!\\nYes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!\\nNo way! I know that area. I lost a toe ring there once.\\nWhy do girls put rings on their toes?\\nWhy not?\\nIt's like putting a hat on your knee.\\nMaybe I'll try that.\\nYou all right, ma'am?\\nOh, yeah. Fine.\\nJust having two cups of coffee!\\nAnyway, this has been great.\\nThanks for the coffee.\\nYeah, it's no trouble.\\nSorry I couldn't finish it.

I can't believe you were with humans!\\nGiant, scary humans!\\nWhat were they like?\\nHuge and crazy. They talk crazy.\\nThey eat crazy giant things.\\nThey drive crazy.\\nDo they try and kill you, like on TV?\\nSome of them. But some of them don't.\\nHow'd you get back?\\nPoodle.\\nYou did it, and I'm glad. You saw whatever you wanted to see.\\nYou had your \\\"experience.\\\" Now you can pick out yourjob and be normal.\\nWell...\\nWell?\\nWell, I met someone.\\nYou did? Was she Bee-ish?\\nA wasp?! Your parents will kill you!\\nNo, no, no, not a wasp.\\nSpider?\\nI'm not attracted to spiders.\\nI know it's the hottest thing, with the eight legs and all. I can't get by that face.\\nSo who is she?\\nShe's... human.\\nNo, no. That's a bee law. You wouldn't break a bee law.\\nHer name's Vanessa.\\nOh, boy.\\nShe's so nice. And she's a florist!\\nOh, no! You're dating a human florist!\\nWe're not dating.\\nYou're flying outside The Hive, talking to humans that attack our homes with power washers and M-80s! One-eighth a stick of dynamite!\\nShe saved my life! And she understands me.\\nThis is over!\\nEat this.\\nThis is not over! What was that?\\nThey call it a crumb.\\nIt was so stingin' stripey!\\nAnd that's not what they eat.\\nThat's what falls off what they eat!\\nYou know what a Cinnabon is?\\nNo.\\nIt's bread and cinnamon and frosting. They heat it up...\\nSit down!\\n...really hot!\\nListen to me!\\nWe are not them! We're us.\\nThere's us and there's them!\\n\"), keys: [], span: Some(10..11)}}}")
